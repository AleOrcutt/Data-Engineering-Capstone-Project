Daniela A.,"Manteca, CA",0,1,5/20/2022,"The staff at this Urgent care when above and beyond for me. I went in yesterday and the front staff was nice and gave me an accurate wait time, one of them was kind enough to print and laminate an insurance card for me. When the doctor saw me she addressed all my concerns and questions in detail and with compassion. She did extra procedures on my leg that I know other doctors wouldn't have taken the time to do. my mediations had been sent to the pharmacy of my choice before I even stepped out of the clinic. Today they even called me for a follow-up. I hope I don't need to go back but if I do, I feel confident I will be in good hands.",,,,,,,,,,

Alice K.,"Los Angeles, CA",94,75,5/27/2022,"I have come to Downtown Urgent Care for multitude of reasons: from slicing my hand open while trying to take an avocado seed out, TB testing for work, food poisoning, and more. I am sincerely thankful to the staff and doctors here for consistently taking good care of me. They accept most health insurance which is helpful; I have bounced around from Blue Shield, Anthem, and Kaiser, and they accept all of them. Drive around the block and usually you can find easy street parking. Wait time can occasionally be long, so I do recommend you call in ahead of time.",5,,,,,,,,,
G V.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,29,4/5/2022,Love the people providing medical care. Did not love the lady that picked up the phone. I'm in extreme physical pain and I called in for wait time. I was asking about wait time and she just hung up on me. Lol. I've been here before a long time ago. the actual provider she was sweet and helpful. And I think there was one nurse. She has braids. She may not be here anymore. Who was also cheery and nice. My nurse helped me feed the meter when I was seeing the provider. But I like how I am physically and blinded by pain and got hung up on. Yay!,3,,,,,,,,,
Stephanie W.,"Los Angeles, CA",466,258,3/4/2022,"After posting this review, I heard from their customer service team within days. I am expecting a refund in the mail. The customer service team, Danielle specifically, was great in their outreach and extremely apologetic for the issue I had run into. I appreciate them fixing this issue, and their honesty in that it should have been resolved sooner.That being said, my experience getting a rapid test here was quick and smooth. I had my results within minutes.",72,3,,,,,,,,
Portida T.,"Los Angeles, CA",172,342,1/7/2022,"No doctor in-office at 10:30am? YIKES. They didn't know when the doctor was coming in....

That's not good.*** I came before 11am for PCR and did not get results back until the next day at 11pm** don't come here if you want a PCR for travel. You won't get it in time. If you're here for a COVID test NOT using insurance, you can get your test done with an RN. If you want to use insurance, you'll have to wait to be seen by the NONEXISTENT MD. A little tricky don't ya think?COVID Antigen= 95 bucksCOVID PCR= 150Parking: They allegedly have one, but the gate was down...",65,5,1,,,,,,,

We waited maybe about 15 mins when we got brought back to a room and was assisted by Anh ""with and H"" ha! She was so sweet and had a complete conversation with my daughter which I love. There so many urgent cares that I've gone to where the nurse completely ignores the child but not here everyone was so kind and amazing. Great job. Robert was great too at doing the wound care and upon check out Valeria was amazing. I must say Dr Chung is A M A Z I N G !!!",48,1,,,,,,,,
Amber G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,5/10/2022,"I came to get X-rays done and they were insistent on not being able to find my insurance number because I didn't have a physical card only a picture. They told me my only option was to pay out of pocket which started at $99, I needed an X-ray of my hand done and I'm covered by kaiser *ONE OF THE INSURANCES THEY LIST ON THEIR WEBSITE* I left and spent half an hour on the phone with Kaiser member services making sure I was covered and even got my member card downloaded onto my phone wallet. I went back to provide what they asked for. the younger receptionist immediately told me they ""don't scan"" any cards?? She was rude from the first time we went in but when we came back she was especially unprofessional interrupting me and then ?? snarling ?? at me when I asked her to let me finish what I was saying.

Nenalinda V.,"Los Angeles, CA",63,107,9/8/2021,Horrible experienceI went with my elderly cousin and they still did not care she was struggliing and passing back and forthThey made me wait 1 1/2 hour.Then when I finally went in the woman said I needed to pay when she has full medicare and medical.The staff there are not very experienced. And on top of that they dont separate patients they make you wait in the lobby with people that are actually have symptoms. Not a good idea.This is not the right place.I regret coming and waiting 2 hours of my time with a really sick person.,15,1,,,,,,,,
Cassidy F.,"Los Angeles, CA",235,355,8/14/2021,"This is the best urgent care I've been to so far, and not just because I actually felt better. They have excellent service and are super clean. I've never been here before but it was super great to know they had free parking in a parking garage. And just walking into the patient rooms, you see how clean and organized it is, which is also great. I had terrible heartburn as a side effect of a medication I was taking and nothing seemed to help. I visited here and I saw Dr. Obzejta. She seemed to actually care and have concern for her patients. She prescribed me medication and also gave me a referral for a specialist just in case.Overall, I really recommend this place. Everything is super clean and the staff here will actually take care of you. They won't try to rush you out like many other urgent cares. Plus they also have $5 off when you check in!",912,1,1,,,,,,,
Nenetzyn B.,"CA, CA",0,4,5/10/2022,They got me into a room and took my blood pressure pretty quickly. Ladies out front didn't know how to look up my insurance information.

Tat C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,13,10/3/2021,"The doctor here is a COVID-denier, an anti-vaxxer, and provides BLATANTLY FALSE MEDICAL INFORMATION. She tried to convince me not to get the COVID vaccine because I had already gotten Covid once before, and she said that I am immune for life after getting Covid once. Oh really, then why are so many people getting reinfected / infected more than once? Is she a scientist? Has she conducted tests to prove her claims that getting Covid once grants you immunity for life?It is INCREDIBLY damaging to the downtown community as a ""health care professional"" to be making false claims that can directly lead to sickness and deaths. She was sounding like a legit conspiracy theorist during my appointment, saying that the government just wanted to scare people into getting the vaccine.She even went as far as claiming that the directors of the clinic wanted to offer vaccines, but she told them that if they did, she would quit. What kind of doctor doesn't believe in science?",1,19,5,,,,,,,

Forrest R.,"South Scottsdale, Scottsdale, AZ",0,5,6/4/2022,"Well where do I begin let's see I'll start with level of how Â busy it was, surprisingly at an all time low only one other customer( I think to myself this should be not too bad) I had my Service animal with me as well with required paperwork but to my surprise which finding out later was illegal on the facility's part I was denied service due to my service animal Strike 1. After taking additional time out of my day to drive back to my apartment drop off my service animal and return I find 3 other customers in front of me not a problem after waiting 40 minutes to be put in a room to wait an additional 40 minutes for a simple prescription refill Strike 2 and to take the cake in this cluster Phuk of a situation the customer service (Paddy /specifically was her name can't recall if the spelling is correct ) apparently she was having a bad day starting with denying access to my service animal she then continued to have conversations about me in Spanish right in front of me obviously being a white male I held my tongue under the assumption she had made on her part that I didn't know what she was saying (unfortunately for her I spend a portion of my year donating my time with others to build houses in Mexico so comprehension wasn't an issue on my part) thus the reason policy is formed in professional settings so that the patron or customer doesn't feel isolated or concerned when fellow employees converse in other dialects to essentially talk down upon you in secret or delay you from being serviced",3,,,,,,,,,
Frank P.,"Torrance, CA",9,37,11/12/2021,"I've been here many times and always got great care -- but on my most recent visit, the young female physicians assistant who treated me mentioned that since I had been vaccinated I was at ""much higher risk of heart attacks"" -- this simply isn't true? There are some risks of vaccination for young men like myself, including myocarditis and pericarditis -- but those risks seem to be largely outweighed by the benefits of the vaccine. She said ""dozens"" of her patients had heart attacks after receiving the vaccine. There's no way this is factual. Also, I never saw a doctor during my visit, only this physicians assistant. I assume when I pay for a visit to an urgent care I'll see a doctor, but that wasn't the case. I don't want to go back knowing I might be treated by someone who's anti-vaccine. It makes me wonder at the hiring practices of this location.",5,2,,,,,,,,

Ray J.,"Los Angeles, CA",202,54,9/28/2021,"Writing this review after my second visit; I highly recommend this urgent care clinic. Â The facility is clean, the nurses are friendly, and the doctors are not condescending or patronizing. Â I first came in after I slammed my thumb in a car door. My wait was 30 minutes and after receiving an x-ray on site, the doctor confirmed that I had a small fracture on the tip on my thumb. Â Ouch.The first doctor I saw was compassionate. Â At the time, she didn't feel that it was appropriate to drain the fluid collecting underneath my fingernail. Â She wrote my prescription and the nurse on-site, Anh, delicately wrapped my crushed finger. I came back 2 days later after the pressure in my nail bed became intolerable. Â I saw a second doctor who drained my finger and there are no words for the sweet relief of releasing fluid that's making your finger feel like it's in a vice.Make sure your health insurance covers urgent care. Â While I was in the waiting room, there were a few people caught off guard after finding out they had limited insurance coverage. Â That speaks more to the necessity of universal health care than the staff or the facility.Overall, I had a 5 out of 5 experience and thank you Anh for your recommendation and for taking care of my thumb!",26,1,,,,,,,,

If you use your insurance they make you wait at least 45-50 minutes while they ""check"" your insurance. Their version of ""checking"" is about 35 minutes of chit chat between co-workers, mixed in with some personal cell phone time. The last 10 minutes is actually on the phone.

I said i cut myself and I was trying to go to urgent care and she rudely told me they weren't accepting patients and I should have gotten there at 7:30 when they stop accepting patients.

So the next day the pain is even worst went to a podiatrist and turns out I had a foot infection from stepping on a nail !

Tabetha J.,"Los Angeles, CA",179,212,8/22/2019,"Updating my review. Last time I declined one test and took one test, got treatment and got better. They obviously make lots of money off of these quick tests and that's fine. But they always want to do at least two and patients should be able to decline. Â This time, when I declined an eye test when the main reason I was there was for what seemed like mono symptoms, the doctor refused to see me without me agreeing to take an eye test. I waited 2hrs for this awesome service. When you are sick and vulnerable and told that you need tests and the doctor refuses to evaluate you before even issuing the test - something seems very wrong with that.",309,4,1,,,,,,,
Jeniffer H.,"Echo Park, Los Angeles, CA",0,1,10/6/2021,I brought my little sister in for an infected ingrown nail. She's very scared of blood and has a very low pain tolerance.

Â One of the staff in particular, Daniel, was extremely helpful and joked around with me which made the time pass by quicker. Â Doctor Chung was extremely detailed in explaining what might've happened and after he saw my x-ray he explained that I should probably wear a boot / crutches but never pressured me into making an ill-informed decision of purchasing things that I didn't need from them. Â Ended up in a boot and all is well. Â Would highly recommend this location for your needs! Â Everyone is extremely helpful, attentive, and nice!",,,,,,,,,,
Govind M.,"Los Angeles, CA",47,26,6/17/2021,"I showed up here at 7:35 with a bleeding elbow - it says clearly on Yelp , their website and on a sign at their entrance that they close at 8. The door was locked and there were 5 or 6 patients waiting inside . After knocking a nurse came and said they were closed - I said it is 25 minutes before 8 - she says - we have patients waiting and by the time we are done with them it will be 8 , and the doctor will not see any other patients . I said there are no other patients trying to get in - I fell , have a terrible laceration on my elbow , I'll bleeding and could barely drive here , I might have a cracked elbow , can you please request the doctor to see one more patient ? She goes in, asks the doctor , returns and says no - please go to ER at a nearby hospital . The doctor has obviously forgotten his or her Hippocratic oath , and these Â greedy leeches have no interest Â in the well being of their patients . Absolutely shameful and a disgrace to the medical community - I will be making formal complaints to every single medical organization - and posting this everywhere I can -",58,2,1,,,,,,,
Valerie P.,"Lancaster, CA",20,47,7/27/2021,"This place is conveniently located within walking distance of my work. They only take walk-ins, no appointments. I showed up around 4:30 on a Tuesday and was immediately told it was 2-2.5 hour wait. I was hesitant to leave, but stuck it out. Luckily, I was taken to a room about 45 minutes from check in. I was seen maybe 15 minutes after I was placed in a room. I spent maybe five minutes with the doctor, which was enough to verify and discuss my issue and a treatment plan. I did not feel rushed by either the doctor or any of the staff. I did not feel like I was a bother to anyone. I was able to purchase the recommended antibiotics here as well which was SUPER convenient. I was in and out in about 75 minutes. The doctor was Asian and was fluent in English (no offense) which is a big thumbs up for me. The clinic was clean and the staff was very friendly.

Abagael W.,"Atlanta, GA",0,4,1/1/2021,"My boyfriend and I woke up on Christmas Eve not feeling great. Being the holiday, many testing locations were closed but we wanted to get tested ASAP and Downtown Urgent Care was open. We waited in line for four hours but they obviously had a system and were doing everything they absolutely could to move the long line of people. Once we finally got inside for our test we were warmly greeted and we'll taken care of. Our nurse was obviously tired as she kept scrambling her words but she turned it into a laugh and made us smile. The doctor was patient with our questions and didn't seem like he was rushing us out as I had expected with the line they had outside. They're risking their lives for the people of LA and they deserve infinite stars. Thank you.",,1,,,,,,,,

Sasha T.,"Los Angeles, CA",213,325,3/18/2020,"My last visit to Downtown Urgent Care was not nearly as positive a visit as my first one a few years ago. Â My entire ""checkup"" lasted 5 minutes, where the practitioner told me that they didn't have the proper equipment to check my ears.

Mark L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,8/4/2021,"So I came here Monday 8/2/21 for some blood work/ekg and urine analysis. The ekg took beyond forever to complete, the assistant mentioned it was probably because I was wearing lotion. Not only that, but as she was putting on the pads/wires for the ekg, it kept pinching my skin uncomfortably. I went to a local ER shortly after this visit and they were able to complete just fine and within minutes and without being pinched. The assistant who also drew my blood gave me massive hematoma and from the looks of it burst my vein. After she withdrew the needle, it hurt in no other way I've felt before getting blood drawn in my life. To add to this, when she applied the gauze and bandage tape, she wrapped it way too tight, causing a huge lump in the area she drew blood from. It was almost unreal to see it was almost the size of a golf ball. These pictures attached are. I even showed the physician and her response was ""wow that's odd"". Very disappointing. Since then the bruising has only gotten worse and it continues to hurt. I urge everyone to stay away from this place. All they cared about is if they were going to be paid at the end of the visit and gave not only 2 incorrect EKG readings but also this terrible hematoma/bursted vein. Anyone who sees this message, run away from this establishment.",6,,,,,,,,,

Â The doctor took time to listen, ask and explain everything well! I personally have Kaiser but I've opted for coming in here as a cash patient. They're IV treatments are GREAT!!

They do testing for any illnesses on site which is super quick & painless & not to mention they do Â have most medicine you need on site so you don't need to drive somewhere else which is amazing in dtla because nowhere has parking BUT this place does so that's really nice. I love the staff here they feel like family ( probably because I'm literally always getting sick so by now we're all on first name basis) hahah. But urgent cares are normally a headache and a half to go to but this is prettY much my primary care physician - and i don't ever worry about wait times and they don't hit you over the head with prices so that's pretty cool too! Super super clean offices and thatS always reassuring.

I called ahead and informed them that I wanted to bring my elderly mother who is undergoing strong chemo therapy and they initially expected her to wait to in line. After me advocating for her they agreed to put her in a patient room! Again seemingly clueless to how susceptible this particular patient group is to catching everything! Â I have also counted 3 other elderly patients that have been in line for hours!

Danielle A.,"Ashburn, VA",1,18,8/10/2019,"This urgent care is definitely better than other Urgent cares in town. By that, I mean it's cleaner, faster, and doesn't have cockroaches scurrying across the floor like some of the other urgent care's I've been to.However, both times I've been to this center, I've had lab work done and it is literally IMPOSSIBLE to receive my results. The first time they left me a voicemail saying they had ""important information"" and I returned the call 5 minutes after, and every day for a week and was always told that my call would be returned.I went again for a UTI, and was told that they would run tests to see what kind of antibiotics I need, and was given a ""guess."" I was told I would be called 3 days later adjusting the medication. Well, it's been 7 days and I still have a UTI. I called the Urgent care and asked why I wasn't called. They said that lab work takes 5-7 days and when I said it has been 7 days, they assured me they would call me ""right"" back. They are now closed, and I still have a UTI.

Nathan E.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,3,9/21/2019,"My partner and I live in the area and have used this urgent care as our 'neighborhood' go-to for the past 18 months and have had good experiences - clean, friendly, professional and helpful. Very happy with DUC.That said, an experience today left a bad taste in my mouth. My partner had been in recently for a viral infection which they correctly diagnosed and prescribed a common antibiotic. A week and a half later the infection returned and, having started a new job and new insurance literally a week before the initial infection that brought her in to DUC, she didn't have a new primary care doctor to call to order new medication.I called in (my partner being in too much pain to talk) explained the situation making it clear upfront I understand in normal circumstances we should be contacting her primary care doc and not them, asked them what they could do to help out with a refill since, with a new job and being sick 2 of her first 3 weeks, she's Â obviously had little opportunity to get her primary care doc squared away.Person on the phone could not have cared less. Literally repeated back to me, in a dull monotone, 'this is something for her primary care doctor, we only deal with urgent care needs, she's welcome to come back in for an evaluation.' Um...did I not start the conversation by acknowledging all of that??Look I get it - we were asking for a favor and shouldn't expect anything in return - but I'd like to think being a regular customer and explaining our predicament should entitle us to something beyond complete indifference? I regret (and sincerely apologize) that in hearing this I was not happy and responded with a choice word of my own, but that's how customers tend to act when they call in need help and get treated with indifference. And we weren't asking for the Ebola vaccine here, refill was for 8 tablets of an extremely common medication, it's As a former 12 year-owner of a service business, let me offer you few pieces of advice:1. Train your employees to act like they give a damn when customers call. If you're calling an urgent care, you probably aren't having a great day.2. Consider, maybe, having some wiggle room in your policy or empower employees to make judgement calls if someone who has used your service repeatedly needs help - maybe have a one time exception that a manager can approve, offer to fill the prescription for a reasonable fee or invite the patient in for a visit at a discounted price given it will be strictly for the purposes of obtaining a prescription. Again, no one 'owes' us anything but customers who feel they aren't valued probably won't owe your business much in the way of loyalty.",,3,1,,,,,,,
Madeleine G.,"San Francisco, CA",0,4,12/20/2021,"I went to this urgent care recently as I had intense abdominal cramping that I was certain happened due to ovulation and I wanted to get tested for pregnancy as I felt so awful, it was too early for home tests, and my obgyn didn't have appointments until later that week. Â Well, I wish I had waited until later that week. Â I went in, explained how I was feeling, said that I just wanted a blood test to confirm one way or another. Â 2.5 hours later, blood was finally taken, only after I met with a ""doctor"" who asserted that I could have appendicitis and he should run tests for that at additional cost. Â I don't have this, I didn't have a fever, which is the key sign. Â He should have said, you should wait and go to the obgyn, but no. Â Instead they did a bunch of unnecessary tests, and best yet, never called with the results for the one which I requested they did do. Â So why did you take blood if you weren't going to send it in to be tested? Â Absolute waste of money and time. Â Would never recommend this center to anyone. Â Bills are still coming for that visit which did absolutely nothing.",,,,,,,,,,

Grace K.,"Long Beach, CA",553,82,10/25/2019,"I rolled my ankle last night and googled ""urgent care"". I chose this office over a closer one due to better reviews.Dr. Rad (yeah, that's his real name lol) saw me within 15-20 minutes, I got x-rays taken, and was told to get either crutches and/or a walker boot. The nurse, Anh, was very patient with me, explaining what the doctor recommended and why, and the options to either purchase the equipment from this location, Amazon, or a pharmacy.I appreciated her honesty and I could tell her genuinely wanted what's best for me.Everything is great so far, but this where the 5 stars really comes in: I walked out with a pair of crutches that didn't 100% fit me. When I got to the car, I realized, I needed to change out my crutches or I'd be suffering. My partner went back to the office with them and eventually, my partner and Anh came out. Anh made some adjustments to them, but they didn't help.Anh then called her office manager, Tina, about the situation, and asked her if she could pick up a pair of the right-sized crutches to this location so I could pick it up the next day. Tina agreed, which I thought was really cool, given LA traffic and her having to go out of her way.But I wasn't able to make the time (had to be back in OC early morning), so Anh said I could go to any of their 19 locations and swap out the crutches. I really felt so grateful, but I didn't want to have to go out of my way tomorrow (today) to get these crutches while I was at work.By this time, my partner ended up finding a CVS nearby that sold crutches my size. I told Anh that I wanted to return the crutches ($50) and get a new pair at CVS. Anh called Tina to cancel her plan to drop by another location or let other locations know about my coming in to swap.They hung up, and I was ready to give back the crutches to head to CVS. In that moment, Tina called and told Anh refund me but to let me still keep the crutches because she didn't want me to be crutch-less, in the event I wasn't able to get a new pair from CVS.I was pretty blown away, to be honest. I didn't know what to say. I was so grateful for their gesture of care and attention to my needs and preference. I really appreciated it, especially during the stress of the unfortunate accident.Thanks so much, Anh, Tina, and Dr. Rad. Much appreciated!!!",43,1,,,,,,,,

Lion R.,"Seattle, WA",1,26,4/16/2019,I really don't know why they have 5 stars ! First the girls in the front desk are not really welcoming and can't answer straight to any question. They don't accept most of the insurances and they completely overcharged. It looks very fancy inside so you understand what you are paying for because it's certainly not for the service. The doctor came to see me for barely more than 5 minutes. Asked me general questions and left as fast as he came. According to him I had a throat infection so I got antibiotics for about a week. After taking all the meds I did feel a bit better but never healed. I didn't have time to go back but also no real reasons too. After two weeks the pain was back but I waited a bit more to be sure. How can you still be sick after taking so much meds ? Anyway I came back there telling them that I won't pay again because I think the diagnosis wasn't good and not thorough at all after paying around $250 for 5mn of consultation! They say no you will have to pay full price again. I then decided to storm outside coz I rather give my money to a real doctor. Finally I went to another doctor that accepted my insurance and told me that I don't have an infection so I took antibiotics for nothing (dangerous huh?). I didn't have to pay anything and got the right treatment.,16,3,1,,,,,,,

Zee G.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,40,5/26/2019,"I've never been more impressed with an urgent care than I am with Downtown Urgent Care. I came here because I thought I fractured my hand. The first thing I noticed is how CLEAN and SPOTLESS it is. The staff was very kind and efficient. I was seen immediately after I walked through the door. In 30 minutes total, I was checked in, my vitals were taken, an x-ray was done of my hand, the doctor reviewed the results, evaluated my hand, spoke to me, put a wrist brace on me, and I checked out. Anh, the nurse, and the other staff members made the entire experience very pleasant and explained everything to me at every step. I commend this facility for providing such excellent urgent care. This is the epitome of what health care should be.",2,1,,,,,,,,

I'm absolute the worst when it comes to getting shots or my blood drawn and I literally pass out almost every time. She gave me, by far, the best experience I've ever had with those situations.

Lisa U.,"Rosemead, CA",8,59,8/4/2019,"I can see why this place warrants the 5 stars rating ! Minimum wait, efficient staff , thorough doctor , free parking , and clean facility !Thank you Dr. Chung and staff for the most painless urgent care experience . In an out within the hour with solutions to my concern and prescription called in ! As a bonus , they are a ""Â blue familyÂ "" so patients with certain anthem blue cross insurance (ours is PPO) get billed under pcp visit instead of urgent care visit . For most instances , that translates to a lower patient co-pay.Shoutout to Anh for her care, friendliness, and professionalism. Thank you for making my experience a comfortable one at every visit !!",6,,,,,,,,,
Katey H.,"Austin, TX",87,15,5/10/2019,"I've literally never been to an urgent care that I could say nice things about, but this was a fantastic experience through and through. I've been experiencing some symptoms of anxiety, but recently moved to LA and didn't have a primary care physician yet. I saw the good reviews and decided to take a chance despite the fact that urgent care isn't the best place to get an anxiety diagnosis, but they blew my expectations away. Everyone was so nice and Dr. Chung spent a fair amount of time with me, enough to calm me down and talk through my options and medical history. I highly recommend this facility!",1,1,,,,,,,,

Kelly C.,"Los Angeles, CA",20,52,2/26/2019,"I took my 7 year old son a little after 2 pm today and was checked in with no wait. Receptionist, nurse and Dr. Chung were all great. They checked my insurance coverage right away and had no issue.We waited about 40 minutes to see Dr. Chung who was awesome. He was almost like a pediatrician and checked my son carefully and thoroughly. He didn't rush and took time to listen to me and to explain his diagnosis. From the beginning to end, he made sure I was leaving with no concerns. I had never visited an urgent care and only went to the emergency, but this will be my go to place now if I can't immediately see my primary doc. This place is also very clean and has free parking.

Sunshine L.,"Mays Landing, NJ",49,2,5/2/2019,"5 stars is not enough to summarize my experience at Downtown Urgent Care. From the beginning to the end of my visit, the staff were the ultimate professionals.

Â I didn't mention that I was a nurse, and that in addition to my full time job, I work part time at an Urgent Care.

Katja Y.,"Downtown Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",238,7,7/15/2019,"I had a really negative experience here where in the doctor basically ignored everything I was saying and decided that the ear infection that I've had multiple ear swab petri-dish tests for already and confirmed was bacterial is fictional and in my head and psychosomatic. (I just went here to get a prescription replacement for a lost prescription while traveling because I could not contact my doctor over the weekend) he even suggested I should stop taking the antibiotics I was prescribed when it is very bad for antibiotic resistance to stop taking antibiotics before the full course is over. I have since been to two other doctors, who were appalled at the advice he gave. I would never ever go here again",,4,,,,,,,,
Michele C.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,17,7/1/2019,"This urgent care is a bit of a sham. Â They are $30 more than other urgent care office visit charges I've been to and they tried to bully me into tests I didn't want. Â I kept telling them I am a cash patient and I am poor so, I can only pay for what is absolutely necessary. Â I let the doctor know that I've been through these same symptoms all my life about every couple years and I just needed antibiotics. Â She pretty much rolled her eyes and said, well then you should know that bronchitis and pneumonia are treated differently. Â When I asked how so, she said, ""we typically give a shot for pneumonia."" Â I said, ""I've had it 7 times and never got a shot."" Â Finally she said she would have the staff talk to me about cost of X-rays and the streptokinase test I also did not want. Â I've had strep, Â this was not strept. Â She said she would be back. Â I asked the Nurses asst Â would the doctor be able to read the xrays immediately? Â ""Well, yes but we have to send them out for official reading and then get back to you in a couple days"". So basically my answer? ""NO"". Â It felt more like a money mill. They left me for 10 more minutes then they came back said I could go. Â My prescription and bill is up Front. The Doctor did not come back to see me or to describe anything about the Rx she was giving me. Then admin staff acted as if I was stiffing them while I paid my 160 dollar for the 40 minutes of time I wasted. Â The Dr. gave me the same thing every other Urgent care Doc has given me the last 10 times over 30 years. Â Advice? Try the one in Arts District next time. Â Maybe they are better. ONE nurse's assistant saved this place from a 1 star. Â  She smiled understandingly when I told her I was broke. Â Everyone else acted like I was an inconvenience. Â Thank nice assistant person, for looking at me and treating me like a human when I am sick and don't feel well. At least they called me the next day.",3,5,,,,,,,,

Vince S.,"Washington, DC",10,9,1/11/2020,"I came in complaining of a cold I had been fighting for more than 2 weeks that had quickly begun worsening in the hours before I came in. I had attributed some of my symptoms (in particular, severe body aches) to side effects of the steroids that another doctor prescribed me a couple of days prior. Dr. Chung told me I could safely stop taking the steroids but astutely observed that I may have been presenting early symptoms of the flu. They administered a couple in-office treatments for short-term relief and he sent me off with a prescription for several medications that I picked up that evening. I woke up in the middle of the night with a high fever and knew immediately that I had the flu once the in-office treatments had worn off. Thanks to Dr. Chung, I had everything I needed to survive the flu. He even prescribed me Tamiflu which definitely quickened my recovery. I was back on my feet after 2.5 days (last time I had the flu this took 4-5 days).I am very happy with my visit here and with Dr. Chung in particular.",5,,,,,,,,,
Sophie A.,"Santa Monica, CA",202,7,9/14/2019,"I typically go to Brentwood Urgent Care as it's closer to my house but while at a friends house downtown I developed a horrible pain in my back and a high fever quickly. I found this urgent care on yelp and went over immediately. The wait on a Friday night was super quick (less than 10 mins), and I was supported by 3 nurses and a doctor. They heard all my concerns, took every test I asked for and then some (including chest x-rays and a double hit of a nebulizer for a nasty cough, a concern of mine as a regular THC vape user). I received a painkiller & anti-inflammatory injection for my back as well as an antibiotic injection, and was able to get all my prescriptions provided to me w extensive dosage details upon check out.As someone who hates needles, they allowed me time to relax and regain my composure before checking out even after the office had closed. In addition, a nurse waited outside with me for my Lyft to pick me up. This facility was immaculately clean, the staff was friendly, and I felt like I was in great care which was a concern of mine in DTLA as someone who typically gets all my medical treatment in Beverly Hills.

Wendy C.,"Los Angeles, CA",51,13,1/13/2018,"I came in after 4 days of fever, a terrible cough, trouble sleeping and breathing, and what I called the super flu. A summary of my visit: - Dr. Chung was not in the office, so a PA saw me instead- Paid $159 with insurance just for the office visit, which lasted less than 30 minutes- No flu swab, no strep test, no tests of any sort were administered- Prescribed Advil and AUGMENTIN - an antibiotic for a sinus infection caused by my fluThe reason I'm giving this urgent care one star is because I am severely allergic to penicillin, a fact that I put on my paperwork and reiterated to each person that came in and saw me. Augmentin is a penicillin antibiotic, meaning I could have gone into anaphylactic shock had I gone ahead and taken the medication I paid for and picked up at the clinic. I went in for some potential tests and fluids, not to be potentially sent to the emergency room for negligently prescribed medication. I got absolutely nothing out of my visit, and I still feel terrible.",26,18,2,,,,,,,

Iceis M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,10/23/2020,"I've been meaning to give a review to Downtown Urgent Care, but time has gotten away from me and it has led me to forget. Given the circumstances of how everything is going this year, I feel like I should finally give back to them and post my experience. (Apologies for long backstory). Prior to the visit, I was having some difficulty hearing in my right ear and thought it was just water build-up since I went swimming on that same day. However, a couple days went by and my hearing worsened. I recently graduated from my university and moved to LA to live with family members for a while, but I will still covered by my school until September. The school had weird requirements for me to fill out before I could even go see a doctor and schedule an appointment just to see if they could cover the cost. I figured it shouldn't take more than a day for them to reply, but my ear started to sting after a few more days and it was very bothersome, especially at work. I never heard from the school so I decided to go to Downtown Urgent Care. The receptionists were very nice and welcoming, as was the doctor (whom I wish I can remember). My right ear had ear wax build-up, which led to an infection. So he put in a few drops of liquid medication that would help dissolve the ear-wax before they tried to flush it out. Unfortunately, this had to continue for about 3 days before my ear was finally cleared up. The doctor gave me some liquid ear drop antibiotics to help with the infection that cost little to nothing. Even though my visit was not an emergency and it was minor, I was really happy on how the staff and the doctor handled my situation and took care of me. Thanks!",,,,,,,,,,

Â *Free parking here! In DTLA/Little Tokyo that is a miracle. Â Especially when you're deliriously sick and stressed out already missing days of work!Normally, if you have any type of cold or flu symptoms, the dr just tells you to rest and get some OTC meds - and that's after you've waited an hour! Â I literally walked in here and was whisked away to the exam room, was offered a bottle of water, and had my vitals taken in under 10 minutes. Â Gabi (the PA or MA) was very quick and professional. Â Felix (another MA or admin) had my insurance verified and explained all of the possible costs to me and then Dr. Chung examined me. Â It turns out I had a sinus/ear infection and need antibiotics and a steroid shot. Â  He patiently answered all of my many questions and had a polite bedside manner. They had my prescription called in, wrote a doctors note for work, gave me a free reusable bag, and I was on my way!

Monica F.,"Austin, TX",24,25,12/5/2017,"There's a reason this place has such great reviews. I went in this morning around 9:30am and was immediately taken back to a treatment room. The nurse who took my vitals was really nice. I only waited about 10 minutes for the doctor to come in, but he was amazing. He really listened to my complaints and went through every symptom with me, asking a lot of questions. You can get your prescriptions filled there, too. But they don't accept insurance for that. You have to pay cash or card. I ended up getting my scripts there because I think they would have been cheaper than my insurance, and I was sick and didn't feel like making an extra stop at the pharmacy on my way home. All in all, I think I was only there for about 30 minutes. And the medicine combo that the doc gave me had me feeling better within a couple hours. Love this place.

It is located in the same building and you just need to let the parking attendants know you are there to visit the urgent care and it is FREE. I bought my prescription at the office but recommend going to a pharmacy if you aren't in a rush- much cheaper. They will inform you that one is located across the street.

However, the night before going into urgent care, I must have twisted in my sleep and tweaked the muscle. I woke up the next morning shaking in pain and couldn't sit up or roll over without excruciating pain. My roommate basically carried me to urgent care right when it opened. The staff were very friendly--especially the nurse who helped me out. Once she took me to the room, I had to wait around 30 minutes to see Dr. Ghurabi, which seemed like forever when you feel like your spine can't support the weight of your body. When the doctor came in, he asked me standard questions, I explained to him everything that happened, and then he asked me to lie down. I told him that if I lied down, I might never get back up because going from lying to sitting is the most painful. He said he would help me up, had me lie down for all of 10 seconds, and then jerked me up by my arms. In all actuality, him jerking me up was probably less painful than me slowly sitting up on my own, but a warning would have been nice.He then proceeded to do very painful PNF stretching on me, having me twist and bend against his resistive force to stop the muscle from spasming. As a personal trainer, I didn't think doing such high volume stretching on a strained muscle would be a good idea, but he is the doctor. After one minute of even more excruciating pain, nothing had changed and he told me he'd give me a shot in the butt for $30 and a muscle relaxer prescription. I got my shot and my muscle relaxers, slept for two days, and was good as new.The real fun begins with the billing. This whole time--even though I was in pain--I asked specific questions about the billing. I have a very high deductible, so I knew nothing would be covered. They still wanted to take my insurance card to double check--they called my insurance and they were told the same thing that I told them. I was told that my visit would be $150, and when the doctor said he wanted to give me a shot, I asked how much that would be too. He went away for another 15 minutes to double check the price, and told me $30. That was a small price to pay at that moment for the pain I was in. I paid $180 and thought I was done with the visit.Yesterday, I received a statement for another $33.80. Obviously, I was very confused--especially since on the statement it makes no mention of the $180 that I paid in November.I called the Urgent Care and the receptionist--who was actually very sweet--did not understand why I was so confused and kept explaining to me what a deductible meant. Finally, she explained to me that the $150 and $30 that I was quoted were ESTIMATED prices--pending insurance coverage--and that they make sure every patient is fully aware of that. I explained that this was never relayed to me, that I knew my insurance wouldn't cover anything, and that I would have preferred to have known this and paid the full price in November. We went back and forth, and then she gave me a billing number to contact. Billing basically relayed the same information.I've been to urgent care many times and I've never gotten such a blatant dishonesty regarding pricing--I've always just been given a flat rate and paid that. I threw out my full receipts last week. I'm sure on the papers I signed that there is some disclaimer about estimated pricing, however, when you're in so much pain it's hard to read everything that you're signing. When I showed so much concern about the price of the visit and the price of the shot, you would have think that this would have come up.Again, I loved the nurse who treated me, and the facility was very nice, but not worth the headache of dealing with poorly explained billing.",4,7,1,,,,,,,
Kristen M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,29,1/27/2017,"The doctor was amazing and really comforting! I wish this wasn't just urgent care - I'd love to go here for all my medical needs!TIP - if they're giving you antibiotics, I'd suggest not getting them in office because they're more expensive that way! (if you can wait of course) They just gave me a write up and I went to CVS to pick it up - $2 vs. $25!",9,5,,,,,,,,
Arlene B.,"Honolulu, HI",127,5,11/29/2017,"Recently moved to LA...Been here twice and each time I'm in and out within 35 min. I've seen Dr.Chung both times and he's nothing short of professional and thorough. I honestly don't want to bother finding a regular physician cause I'd rather see him all the time! Clean, free parking, and good service from the minute you walk in and out.",,1,,,,,,,,
Karyn K.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,7/7/2019,"Went in on a Sunday morning with backache and I was in and out in less than an hour! Â Pricing was amazing, staff was excellent, and Dr. Chung was phenomenal!!!",,,,,,,,,,
Lauren C.,"Los Angeles, CA",25,23,11/14/2016,"I rarely write reviews and when I do, it's because the experience was either exceptionally wonderful or exceptionally awful. Â I cannot say enough great things about Downtown Urgent Care and Dr. Chung! Here's my story... Last week, I had developed some kind of bronchial infection that resulted in countless hours of coughing to the point of gagging, and it always got worse when I would try to sleep. By Thursday, I was extremely sleep-deprived and couldn't take it anymore, so I went to the Cedars Sinai Urgent Care in Culver City where I work and had visited before. Â The doctor assured me that I did not need antibiotics and prescribed cough medicine with Codeine, Flonase, and Claritin-D. Â I mentioned that my tongue had also become oddly very sensitive with a sort of burning sensation. Â Oh, it's probably nothing. Â None of the medicine helped in the slightest! I was a zombie by Sunday afternoon! Â While on route to Ralphs downtown, I suddenly remembered that there's an Urgent Care place in Little Tokyo - my husband had gone and had a very positive experience! - so I decided the supermarket could wait! Â Everyone was very courteous and professional. Â I probably had to wait about 20-25 minutes total before I saw the doctor.Let me start by saying I wish Dr. Chung could be my primary! He listened to my concerns and took the proper amount of time to examine me. Â He even observed that I may have a thyroid condition, which does happen to run in my family. Â I felt well cared for by him! Â He ended up giving me prescriptions for an antibiotic, an anti-inflammatory, an inhaler, and a topical cream for my tongue. He also told me to brush my teeth with baking powder and rinse with biotene. Â I did everything as instructed and, while I still had some coughing, I finally got some sleep. Â In the morning, I felt 85% better!!! Â This is now my go-to urgent care place when I am not feeling well. Â Wish I had gone the moment I knew a bronchial infection was coming on! Â I wasted a lot of time and lost a lot of sleep not seeing the right doctor!!!PS - I even got a voicemail from them this morning wanting to check in with me to make sure I was OK!!! GREAT SERVICE!!!",1,6,2,,,,,,,
Eleanor B.,"Portland, OR",44,26,11/16/2016,"1) free, convenient parking2) staff is friendly and communicative 4) virtually no wait time3) Dr. Chung was incredible. I've just moved here from NYC and don't have a primary care doctor yet. He not only addressed the issue I came in for, but was incredibly knowledgable about a longstanding medical issue I have (that other doctor's have not even addressed) and provided some suggestions for that. He also then provided some recommendations for some primary care physicians since I am new to the city.If I'm ever need a pinch and don't have time to wait for a doctor, I'll be coming back here.",1,6,2,,,,,,,
Luigi R.,"Downtown Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",0,2,10/4/2019,Came in to the facility over the weekend. The facility was very clean and the staff was very friendly.

Narek K.,"Granada Hills, CA",0,8,3/1/2019,"I took my children here for a check up, they were so polite, i really loved how the nurses gave my 4 year old a shot and he didnt even blink.

Wonderful visit see you in 6 months for another checkup!",3,1,,,,,,,,

Verica C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,6/27/2018,"When you enter the facility, they immediately take you in. No hassle, no crowds, no issues. The place is spacious, clean and fresh. They make you feel as if you were the only patient there! The wait on a doctor is minimal. By the time they take your vitals, the doctor is already there. Dr. Chung is an amazing doctor. He asks just the right questions to narrow down the diagnosis. He instantly makes you feel taken care of, your worries subside and you already feel better. Instructions on medication are clear and precise. And finally, the facility will actually give you a call the following day to see how you're doing! If you happen to be sick and are looking for a professional, efficient, and kind doctor - look no further.",,,,,,,,,,
Jacqueline G.,"Long Beach, CA",62,3,4/25/2019,"Oh my goodness! Â  I visited this clinic recently due to a bout of vertigo. Â Within 45 seconds of my arrival I was placed in an examination room. Â Within 10 minutes of my arrival, I spoke with the medical assistants. Â I was seen by Dr. Chung within 20 minutes of my arrival. Â I left the clinic 20 minutes later. Â I was in and out of the clinic in under AN HOUR!!!! Â The doctor and staff were professional and friendly. Â The facilities were immaculate. Â The lobby and waiting area (although I didn't really wait) were pristine. Â Now, I'm sure if my issues were more serious, it probably would have taken more time. Â BUT, the Doctor and staff were so efficient that it would not matter!!!! Â If you are ever in need of Urgent Care Â (hopefully you won't ever be!) and are in the DTLA area, you should definitely visit THIS clinic.",1,,,,,,,,,
Patricia S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,16,2/4/2020,"I must say that Downtown Urgent Care is the best Â ever!!! I am so grateful to have had the experience of being treated by such caring precise cutting -edge doctor ..I highly recommend Dr, Hsu who treated me last Friday night for a severe leg pain !! Dr. Hsu was so awesome , extremely kind , caring and he was able to truly help me and is just so sweet ! He also is extremely knowledgeable in diagnosing what I have and he made such a great suggestion to help me with the pain --I also want to mention that the front desk receptionists are really sweet and helpful too , and I must commence Medical Assistant Erika on being absolutely wonderful and she really truly cares about each and every patient!! She is the best !! I want to thank Downtown Urgent Care for being such a fantastic Urgent Care Clinic -this Clinic really rocks and it has cutting-edge technology and it's so clean and has such a lovely soothing atmosphere-also they provide their own in-house pharmacy and prescribe you your much needed meds right there!!

Tashawnda B.,"Los Angeles, CA",170,6,4/18/2019,"Oh my gosh !!! I think this is the best Urgent Care I've been to . When I first walked in I was greeted with a lovely smile by Ana . Ana explain how the payment process goes before I went in the back to see the doctor . I was so worried about the cost , but I lucked out and didn't have to pay anything . I was really happy about that . I was in and out real quick , the whole staff from the receptionist to the doctor was so friendly . They didn't judge me , because I was so embrassed about my situation . They even called me the next day to see how I was doing !!!!! I never been to an Urgent Care where they did that ! Hopefully I won't be needed to go to a urgent care any time soon .... but if I have to I definitely will be coming back here !!",5,,,,,,,,,
Leilani R.,"Montrose, Montrose, CA",0,1,6/15/2019,"Let me say this I love this urgent care! The front desk acted a tad bit unprofessional, over all weren't rude so I guess I can't complain. Back office experience on the other hand was great, the X-ray specialist was one of a kind and had very good bedside manners. If im not mistaken the lady who took my X-rays was Erika, she was a very compassionate person. I haven't come across such a caring group of people in a long time, let alone in an urgent care or any medical facility! Dr. Chung took his time with me and was very thorough. The clinical staff were also great & attentive to my needs. I'd have to say my over all experience was great and I'd most defiantly be coming back when I'm in need of some urgent care!!!",,,,,,,,,,
Jhing E.,"Koreatown, Los Angeles, CA",2,15,2/25/2019,"My dad went here to be seen. The doctor saw him immediately and assess him. However, it just took a long time for the lab and xray to be done.

Willow M.,"Los Angeles, CA",257,4,6/14/2018,This is the best Urgent Care I've ever been to. I arrived around 9:30 and was immediately brought into a room. Everyone was very kind. Dr. Jeannette Martello not only helped me with my ear pain but also gave me advice on my skin (breakouts). She took the time to write down recommended products and a routine for me.

Jason T.,"Pine Island, NY",194,2,11/26/2019,Dr. Chung and staff are fantastic. Really friendly welcoming and gay friendly.

E H.,"Pasadena, CA",0,13,5/12/2019,"I've been in to this urgent care clinic twice, and both times I've been blown away not only by their kindness, but also with how willing they are to go above and beyond to make sure you're well taken care of. Just now I went in (on Mother's Day Sunday, no less), had my vitals taken by the absolutely darling nurse named Ahn, and was treated extremely promptly by Dr. Martello. She is so knowledgeable and kind, I felt almost like my own mother was taking care of me. I can't sing this place's praises enough. I can't believe how easy they made this whole experience.",,16,,,,,,,,
Shane R.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,2,11/29/2018,"Wasn't impressed by the level of service I received specifically from the doctor, but the clinic called, asked for my feedback and even refunded the (small) fee I had to pay. Enough to bump up my rating.",,1,,,,,,,,

When it comes to urgent care experiences, and I have had many, this was hands down the best. The staff (friendly and informative), doctor (thorough and calming) and free parking (no one wants to circle block after block when they're sick) made my visit stress-free. My appointment was so good that I'm considering making Dr. Rastegar my Primary Care Physician. And they called the following day to check-in on me. Wouldn't it be nice if this type of care was the norm? Bottomline, my visit was the lemonade that came from my lemon of a Saturday morning.",,5,1,,,,,,,
George M.,"Van Nuys, Los Angeles, CA",0,1,5/31/2018,I honestly hardly write any reviews for anything but the staff and experience was unlike any other .

Right after a business meeting i almost felt like i was going to faint and had no choice but to stop by and get checked out.From beginning to the end the staff was great . Check in was easy and quick... i was getting helped by Regina the nicest most polite nurse I've dealt with. Made me feel calm and relaxed went above and beyond to help me . Â I really dont like dealing with nurses and doctors i feel like there shady and not always honest.. not here they ran multiple test explained what my condition was and it turned out i was allergic to something i never knew about...

He said to tell him exactly what is going on. F%##! If I knew what was wrong I wouldn't be there. He was so incredibly rude. He said I needed an EKG.. since I'm claiming something wrong with my chest. I went ahead with the test. Everything was normal. I complained to the manager. I wasn't charge for the visit...

Gabriel G.,"Long Beach, CA",199,1,1/9/2016,"One of the best urgent care experiences I've had. Trust me, I've had a lot of them.

The last part always being so Â very important when you don't know why your throat is swelling closed and your tongue is roughly the size of your mouth. Everything was taken care of efficiently and quickly. A little peering into the back of my mouth, one shot in the butt, a ""here take these"" and I was outta there in under an hour.

The staff is very friendly and even offered me bottled water. ZERO wait time (maybe Â because it was Sunday?) and very thorough investigation and treatment of my injury.

Susan K.,"San Jose, CA",317,87,12/22/2015,"I've been in such horrible pain for the past 3 days, I tried to wait out the abdominal pain bc I don't have insurance until January.

The fees are very reasonable and I was in and out in under 30 minutes. And I didn't have to clean my house. I was very happily surprised at how nice and quick the service was....and the prices too! The husband and I were quietly discussing how much we thought this was gonna cost me and we were both wrong.

Alexander F.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,2/11/2016,"This was the best experience I've EVER had at a general practitioner's office. I waited for a shorter time here than I usually do when I have appointments with other doctors, and I had just walked in off the street. Dr. Chung was smart, friendly, and easy to talk to. Our interaction never felt rushed (he Â even offered advice to help members of my family!). The staff there (Felix and April) were lovely, helpful, and knowledgable (Felix was able to rattle off insurance information about the surrounding doctors and labs off the top of his head).

Alex R.,"Echo Park, Los Angeles, CA",601,4,12/11/2019,"I showed up WITHOUT an appointment 10 minutes before they were closing the night before THANKSGIVING and they saw me. They took me in even though I'm sure they wanted to go home and be with family and friends and prepare or rest up for the next day. NO OTHER urgent care was open or accepting patients or walk-ins or they were closing early or didn't accept medi-cal insurance. And this place did it all. On top of all that, everyone was so unbelievably nice and friendly. I honestly couldn't believe it. I wasn't sure if they could help me because I had a horrible second degree mouth burn and I didn't know if that was within an urgent care's specialty or scope of treatment, but Dr. Peter Chung not only knew what to do to help me (which I was so grateful for because I was in so much pain), but was so sympathetic of what I was going through. His knowledge and true genuine care along with the friendly nurses and staff was exactly what a person thinks and expects doctors and hospitals and hospitality should be like, but rarely are these days. Also there was no wait time and I didn't have to even ask, they just took the proactive initiative to write me a doctor's note for work/school which came in handy as I had to take off a few days. They just helped so much and thought of everything. Truly considerate and I recovered happy and healthy because of them. Highly recommend going to this urgent care out of literally any other one. I've gone to so many bad ones as I'm sure most of us have. I don't even write reviews, but I was so moved to. This is my first ever yelp review I've done in my life! Ahaha. Anyways, to all the staff, the awesome friendly nurses, and the caring and knowledgeable DR. Peter Chung...THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING, all your help, care, guidance, healing me to a smooth recovery, and making my experience, even when I was in pain from my injury, so enjoyable!!!! If I'm ever sick or injured again...I know where to go!And I'll be back! And weirdly, will look forward to seeing the team there, which felt like family & friends, there again!",,,,,,,,,,
Sam N.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,8/10/2017,"They overcharge you like hell. If you think, you dont know much about insurance and visit to let them take care everything for you, it is most likely you are going to pay more.Went to Urgent care and my deductible has not been met for my insurance which is $50. So as per their policy, if deductible has not met, we need to pay the whole amount for Urgent Care visit(ridiculous-but their policy-its ok) which is $159 + any procedure cost($$$$). We ended up paying the whole amount and they claim the insurance $400(I dont care what they claim-its between them and their agreement) But when our insurance kicks in and says we are only responsible for $80 something, they wont refund you until you call them and visit them multiple times. They wont refund you, so please see your insurance bill after visiting this urgent care and it is very much possible you will get a refund.I went to the urgent care and staff doesn't know what they are talking about or how the insurance works. And they just say they dont owe me anything even after showing the EOB from my insurance. Dont visit unless you are willing to pay more.",,7,2,,,,,,,
Amos C.,"Clermont, FL",72,1,7/19/2016,"Recently found myself in this Urgent care and was surprised at how fast I was helped. The staff was very informative and helpful when it came to explaining how my insurance works. The doctor that helped me talked to me and not at me and made me feel like I was a patient and not like cattle. He also made extra sure I knew when to take the meds he prescribed me before I left. They also called the next day to check up on me, which I didn't expect. I would definitely go back if I found myself sick again.",,1,,,,,,,,

Mac C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,12,7/29/2016,"With no other option than the ER on a Sunday, I decided to try Downtown Urgent Care based on reviews here. We didn't know what to expect since we'd never been to urgent care. Parking is a breeze. Office is relaxing, modern and clean. The friendly and caring staff greet you immediately upon arrival. Wait time including check in and insurance verification was less than 5 minutes. I was seen by Dr. Peter Chung. He was exceptional in every way. Highly knowledgeable and well-informed about my condition, he was able to help me enormously. Plus, he has the best bedside manner I've ever experienced. I never felt rushed and he answered all my questions with helpful input and solutions. Highly Recommend!",,1,,,,,,,,
Jane D.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,26,12/11/2017,"We are new to Los Angeles, so when I got sick, I did not have a primary care doctor to go to. I looked up urgent care on Yelp and found this location. After reading the reviews, I decided it was worth a try.Downtown Urgent Care is wonderful. Parking is easy. The front desk staff and the medical assistants were all incredibly friendly and attentive. Within 15 minutes of walking through the front door, I was seen by Dr. Ladouceur. He was FANTASTIC. He carefully listened to all my concerns. He did a thorough examination and explained what was going on. He took time to make sure I had all my questions answered. It was so far and beyond what I could have hoped for! I highly recommend Downtown Urgent Care.",,2,1,,,,,,,

Anai S.,"Westlake, Los Angeles, CA",0,14,11/20/2018,"OMG have i found the best urgent care ever. My mom, Evelina, took me to Downtown LA urgent care for the first time due to extreme abdominal pain, when i arrived i was met by sweet Roxana that greeted me with a smile. In less than 2 minutes i was taken to a room to get my vitals done by a friendly MA (sorry i don't remember your name). It didn't take long for Dr. Chung to come in, he was amazing, he was all ears about my complaint, he went above and beyond to give me printed information related to my diagnosis, he explained everything that i needed to know. He was as friendly as can be. Armando was also gentle giving me my glut shot and drawing my blood. I wish Dr. Chung could be my primary care physician, i highly recommend this urgent care.

Rudy C.,"Los Angeles, CA",166,204,7/9/2017,I haven't been feeling 100% the last few days and today I woke up not being able to talk at all. I work close to this urgent care and it was worth the visit this morning. The office staff and doctor are all great! They were very welcoming. I waited less than ten minutes to see the doctor. The doctor was incredibly personable. The best part was not having to go to a pharmacy to get a prescription. They have their own pharmacy on-site I assume since they gave me antibiotics on the spot which was so convenient. I was in and out in less than 45 minutes--that's what I call URGENT! Thanks to the entire staff for a great experience and for nursing me back to health!,41,4,1,,,,,,,

It was my first time there and everything was done so smoothly. I was helped in no time at all and didn't have to wait at all even though I came into the center around 11. I was helped by the doctor quickly and told me everything I needed and approximately how long it would take. He was very courteous of my time and wanted to make sure I wasn't stuck there for longer than I needed to. The following day, the center even took the extra step and called me to follow up to see how I was doing! Overall the center was quite a pleasant experience and I will definitely be coming here in the near future and would recommend it to everyone in the downtown LA area.",18,1,,,,,,,,

Â Because of a mixup, there was no MD on duty-- but instead of just keeping me waiting in the exam room, they told me that I'd have a 40-minute wait, so I was able to go out for a coffee and come back half an hour later, at which point I was seen almost immediately.Really excellent.And, on top of everything else... free parking!",,2,,,,,,,,

Dr. Chung was attentive from the get go. As soon as we were at the front desk he was there asking about symptoms. We were in a room within minutes and Dr Chung was with us in no time.

I will definitely return if I have future medical emergencies.",15,5,1,,,,,,,
Jose F.,"Los Angeles, CA",23,1,2/15/2017,"I sent my wife to this clinic because she was feeling really sick. We had two options: going south to the same ""cheap"" clinics and wait the whole day because we don't have an appointment or try something new. I read about this clinic in Yelp, and it said they have affordable rates for the uninsured. She was delight with the service in this clinic she told me that starting from the door to the doctor she felt welcome. The price around 300.00 but with everything include even the medicine. This morning they call, to give a follow up that is something nice. Is worthy because other clinics they rip you off little by little and without notice you spent a fortune. Five stars",,5,1,,,,,,,

Sophia C.,"Alexandria, VA",36,61,2/25/2016,"I strained a calf muscle while in LA on business and could barely walk after 24 hours, so I stopped in to make sure I hadn't torn anything. This was also my first experience at an urgent care center and it was amazing!The waiting room was empty when I arrived around 9am, and everyone on staff was very friendly. There was minimal paperwork (2 pages) and they let me work on it in an exam room while the medical assistant asked me questions and took my vitals, so the process was overall quite efficient. A minute after she left the room, the receptionist came in to let me know how much my copay would be. He also returned my ID and insurance cards and collected the paperwork.Another minute after he left, and Dr. Grigorian entered. She was very friendly and pleasant, and diagnosed my strain very efficiently while also giving me a coherent, succinct explanation of exactly what I did to myself and how it happened. She explained my treatment options, offered me an anti-inflammatory shot and/or pills, and recommended follow-up treatment options, including home remedies as well as additional shots.She also mentioned that they have an on-site pharmacy so I wouldn't have to go anywhere else to get said pills (but of course I could if I wanted). Even though they make more money by selling me additional services and medications, it was very low pressure and they were happy to cost everything out before I decided.I ended up opting for both the shot and the pills, and the medical assistant administered the shot very professionally. My pills were waiting for me when I got back to the front desk a minute later, and the bill was very reasonable. I was in and out in under 30 minutes without ever feeling rushed.Miscellany: They seem to accept a fairly comprehensive list of insurance (I have United which they took no problem), and the facilities were easy to find, brightly lit, and very clean. I ubered, but they also had free parking and made a point of asking if I'd had any trouble getting there and/or parking.Highly recommended! You always hope not to have to see the doctor, but if you do, this one is great.",13,,,,,,,,,
Laura S.,"Beverly Hills, CA",16,22,10/12/2017,I would definitely recommend this urgent care! Dr. Chung and the entire staff is amazing!

I got back into the waiting room and everyone was so nice! I definitely felt welcomed and taken care of from the moment I walked in. The doctor was very informative and was not giving me the sense of urgency or rushing me explain my symptoms. Instead, he was attentive and VERY comforting! I was in and out with a prescription in no time. I definitely recommend this place, I have no insurance so it's $100 to be seen, and the price increases depending on services. Overall, it was worth the $100 because I was informed & taken care of.",29,,,,,,,,,

S C.,"Chino Hills, CA",381,3,3/22/2017,"My assumption is that if I go into an urgent care center, that there would be a sense of urgency. I came in to see a doctor, I got addressed, the nurse took my vitals, from there the nurse left a bottle to urinate in, but gave me no further instruction as to whether I should be waiting for the doctor, going to the restroom (wherever that may be). So with no further instruction, she closes the door after leaving me with a bottle, I've been waiting in this room for more than 20 mins. The nurse then enter the room and asks me, ""oh you haven't urinated yet?"" For any one who has an understanding of an UTI, the pain comes in waiting, so I'm pretty outraged that even now after urinating in the bottle, I'm still sitting in this room, I have still yet to be addressed as to what's going on, how long should I be waiting? What am I waiting for? Post visit:Doctor was informative, got my prescriptive, just glad I got some type of remedy before leaving.",1,2,,,,,,,,

Â The facility opened last December so it is new, in a beautiful building and FREE parking. I walked in and there were several staff people at the counter. They were very pleasant and courteous. Within 2 min I did know that my insurance did not cover the expense, which is fine. The nurse took me to a room and brought me cold water.I filled out 2 papers and immediately a very nice young doctor came to see me. Â He obviously asked lots of questions. He was very knowledgeable and thorough. He examined me and determined it was a muscle sprain.Anyway. The whole experience was excellent.

I only had to pay my 10$ co-payment for the office visit, rather than a 100$ co-payment to the ER. They do onsite x-rays I called ahead of time and made sure. There customer service was on point friendly, helpful, and completely respectful. My son had a fractured finger and as soon as we got there we were put in a room and given the greatest service. The staff was amazing hands down. In and out within a hour. Not to mention the cleanliness of the whole office I was so over the top satisfied. Also got a follow up call this morning to make sure he was doing ok. I highly recommend this Urgent Care the go above and beyond customer care. Thank You Downtown Urgent Care!",,,,,,,,,,

The front desk staff was so lovely and helpful and Dr. Chung was incredible and went above and beyond for me. They accepted my United Healthcare and I was prescribed medication and purchased it on the spot and while they don't accept insurance for medication it was only $30 for two medications. When I got home later that evening I realized I was having difficulty swallowing one of the larger pills prescribed. I called Dr. Chung as they were closing and explained the situation to him, he spent nearly an hour searching for a liquid form of the medication and called numerous pharmacies in my area. He then found one, called in the prescription for me and I went to get it. Upon arriving at the pharmacy all of the pharmacists were asking who my doctor was because even they were surprised at how dedicated he was and said he was so incredible and so eager to find a solution for me. He even left his cell phone number with the pharmacist in case there were any issues since it was now an hour after closing and he would be going home! I could not be more grateful. Even more so, when traveling my bag got lost and I called the urgent care back and they called in a new prescription for me to the nearest pharmacy. Everyone at this Urgent Care is incredible and they really care about you and want to ensure you have a great experience. I have never found a better doctor than Dr. Chung.",15,4,2,,,,,,,

Beth S.,"Sacramento, CA",26,192,12/19/2016,"I've been here a few times over the last couple years, and this is hands-down, better than most doctor's offices I've been to. Â This most reent time was after getting hit with a nasty stomach virus that had me vomiting the entire night/morning. Â I couldn't even keep water down and decided enough was enough. Since we'd recently switched insurance to Kaiser, and I wasn't familiar with how Kaiser works (and didn't know if they offer urgent care rather than an ER) I decided to cop out the cash and drive up the street. Â It wasn't cheap, but I got what I needed--relief from the near constant ab workout, fluids for my dehydrated self and medicine to help me get some sleep. Â Most importantly, they were fast--hardly any wait in the waiting room before I went to an exam room and everyone--Dr. Chang and his staff--were kind, calm and reassuring. Â Came home with a couple of cheap scripts to get me through the next couple days and a day later was finally ready to eat solids again--and keep it all down.",18,1,,,,,,,,
Benjamin S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,8/16/2016,"Best Urgent Care I've been to. I was seen immediately, and Dr. Chung was more helpful, friendly, and concerned than my own doctor! They don't take my insurance, but I wouldn't be hesitant to come back here instead of my general practitioner for any follow ups on this particular issue. You'll be in good hands here, and it's a high end facility. It's the antithesis of the overly-crowded dumping ground of nastiness that is the Hollywood Urgent Care clinic.",,3,,,,,,,,
Darrell T.,"Seaside, CA",46,36,7/10/2016,"I was visiting LA from Monterey and had an issue that needed immediate attention. Found out Urgent Care was a few blocks from where I was staying(The Miyako Hotel) and walked in.They immediately took a few tests,even before I started filling out the questionnaire,and within 10 mins the Dr walked in to see me! I was even able to get the medication there(although not thru my insurance,but it was only $20 and I was in a hurry),thus saving me a trip to the drug store! To my surprise they even called the next day to check on me! I can't express how happy I was with the whole experience. I'm used to waiting much longer at an Urgent Care or Doctors on Duty,even having to leave a number for a call back,so I have nothing but good things to say about the staff and how this business is run. Wish they would open one like this in my hometown!",7,3,1,,,,,,,

Â No waiting took my id and insurance and went right in. Â By the way they accepted my co-pay no hassle. The doctor Chung was amazing! Â  usually at urgent care you are lucky to get a doctor that is barely awake. Â This guy is now my go to for anything medical. Â He spent time with me not a rush job. Â Everything is very clean and new here. He phoned in to my local pharmacy what I needed and off I went. Â I would not go anywhere else nice combo of totally professional and kind.,5,2,,,,,,,,
Hanna H.,"Berkeley, CA",114,55,7/11/2016,"Excellent care! They're open later than most places Downtown. I walked in needing stitches 30 minutes before closing and they still saw me. I am grateful because it would have taken a lot longer and cost way more if they had sent me to an ER. Dr. Chung and the entire office staff were very professional, friendly, competent and courteous. They took time to make sure I understood the procedure, cost and necessary follow-up. They are able to dispense some medications directly, which is great because Downtown pharmacies also close early. The office is clean, quiet and they do have wifi. Parking is free in the lot (just press the button for security and tell them you're there for the Urgent Care). Highly highly recommend!",14,3,,,,,,,,
Ruby Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,1/3/2016,"I have to say this urgent care was a life saver to my new year. This place is 7 mins away from home.

This urgent care was very clean and smelled nice. I've been to some that are gross looking and smell funny. Dr Rastegar saw me in less than 30 minutes helped me with my issue He prescribed medicine and to my luck he had the medicine there, happy because that was one less thing I would have to do is go drive and wait at the pharmacy.

Jason W.,"Los Angeles, CA",15,17,12/21/2018,"I found DUC in a (slight) panic after my Mom sliced her hand open in a cat fight (yes, a literal cat fight!) It was a really bad laceration and I knew she needed medical care. I found this place here on Yelp, and yes, the positive reviews are all fully legit. It was just before closing on a Thursday night and they saw her right away. We only waited about 15 minutes before Lauren and Anh took care of her. The stitches were an absolute work of art. The facilities are clean, modern and very spacious. Any preconceived notions I had about Urgent Care places being dingy and gross were vaporized. In addition, everyone was very courteous, caring and friendly. They even took her Blue Cross/Blue Shield insurance from Michigan, as she's here on Holiday vacation. I can't recommend this place highly enough. God forbid I ever need to come back, but if something gruesome happens, the DUC is my jam. Thank you guys!",6,,,,,,,,,
Katelyn A.,"Irvine, CA",1,14,2/7/2018,The doctor was nice but Idk what happened they didn't send my prescription to the pharmacy. I'm really sick and it takes a lot of strength for me just to get out of my bed. On top of this my phone calls kept getting transferred to the Culver City location and they had the audacity to tell me to drive over to the dtla location. I literally have no strength and it amazes me that a place about care tells a sick patient to drive to the DTLA location.... when they are the ones who messed up my prescription in the first place.,1,4,1,,,,,,,
Tyler T.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,12,12/24/2018,This place is great. Other urgent care places have hours long wait. Not a problem here. I came in for a snowboarding incident and was taken in right away.

Adriana R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,12,1/16/2018,"I came into this facility with the expectations of being seen. I verified through my insurance prior before going to make sure I was in network and I was. I got checked in fast however after going to the back I waited 30 minutes to be told that they couldn't verify my insurance and that it could take 20 more minutes to 2 hours. I left and didn't even get seen and called my insurance right away. They told me they should have an online portal to verify within a few seconds. The mere fact that I had to wait 30 minutes to be told that nonsense is ridiculous. My insurance rep over the phone said they could call and verify over the phone even because it is between business hours. So for the fact they didn't baffles me!They told me they collect payment up front and that is why they do this. Honestly, that is the dumbest reason ever. If I go to urgent care and you do not attend to me because you do not have a quick online system to check my benefits, you are clearly turning my health concern into an emergency by not attending to me. It's odd to see so many 5 star reviews on this business. No business is perfect but if everyone else experienced what I just did then clearly this business does not have real reviews, incentives were possibly offered for such high ratings.",,3,1,,,,,,,

I told them to fax it over and I'll pay it then for the next three weeks they continually called me and told me to pay my bill and I continually told them to send it to me followed by no one sending me the bill. Eventually someone finally sent it and I payed it.

I almost couldn't fill out my forms fast enough to keep up with them : ) They took into consideration that I was paying out of pocket and didn't recommend procedures or lab tests that were unnecessary and would have added extra costs.

They gave me a battery of tests (having gotten consent from me) and x-rays to see if the stinger was still in there. Â The doctor had a great bedside manner. I was given a tetanus booster, antibiotics and thorough cleaning of the wound, which they dressed and I was on my way out in about an hour. Â The next day they called to check in on me.

I made it back to work in no time. Everyone was very kind to me, including the nurse who was super awesome and wonderful! I even received a follow-up call to check in on me the next day and another call from the radiologist to confirm a minor fracture in my finger. Overall it was a very pleasant experience.

A L.,"Sanford, Los Angeles, CA",0,2,2/7/2019,"I've been to this urgent care once before and had a great experience. I went back a couple days ago because I was having some back pain that I thought might be related to some issues I had dealt with in the past. The nurse who got me started was very warm and welcoming. After she left the room, I had to wait 45 minutes before the doctor came in. There were no other patients in the office at the time. This was where my experience started to head south. There's no reason to keep me waiting for that long. After Dr. Peter Chung finally came into the room, he asked the usual questions...What symptoms are you having, etc. I listed off a couple and he responded with ""these are very vague symptoms."" He listed off a couple things that it could be and only offered an antibiotic for something that I may not even have. As I was asking questions to try and understand his ""diagnosis,"" Dr. Chung seemed very annoyed and short with his answers. He then asks me what I came in there thinking I had. Um hello....that's why I'm here! You're supposed to be the professional to tell me what YOU know! He was in the room for no more than 10 minutes. The lack of diagnosis is not even what I am upset about. I honestly should have expected it going into an urgent care office. It was Dr. Chung's bed side manner that made for a horrible experience. I felt like my well-being was not cared for; I felt like a number. To say the least, I will not be returning thanks to Dr. Chung.",,2,,,,,,,,

Allie L.,"Central LA, Los Angeles, CA",0,14,8/30/2017,"I went here after developing a buzzing/ringing sound in one ear right before the weekend and not wanting to wait until the following week to get a doctor's appointment. The wait time was short, staff was polite. The doctor asked a few questions and took a quick look at my ears, said I had some wax buildup and that getting it out via irrigation would help. It didn't and when I told him, he didn't seem to believe me and just said to go see an audiologist. Also, when they were doing the procedure, as I later read, they were supposed to put some drops in my ear in order to soften up the wax. They never did that, and while I don't think the omission had consequences for me, it could have had and it seems very unprofessional to leave something like that out. (If the wax isn't softened there is a heightened chance of damage to the ear as opposed to when it is.)",,2,,,,,,,,

Â I went into the clinic the next day with my insurance cards to get verified, should I need to use their services another time (I tend to be accident prone), so that I would already know my financial responsibility. Â They took a copy of my driver's license and front and back of my insurance card and would contact me with the information. Â 7 days later I have not heard back, so I decided to stop in. Â They lost my information (sensitive patient information) and they couldn't care less.

He was super thorough and knowledgable and wanted to treat my infection swiftly and aggressively, after all my ear drum had ruptured. I was a bit delirious and he was so very kind and patient and made sure I knew exactly how to take the medicine he prescribed. His nurse gave me a strong antibiotic shot there in the office to kickstart the healing. Then I received drops, other antibiotics and pain meds since I hadn't slept because of the pain. The entire process took less than 30 minutes. This place is truly a gem and always reliable. Highly recommended. Update- he referred me to an ENT specialist (for a procedure), and went out of his way to speak with the other doc prior to my arrival, then Chung called me after my appointment to learn how everything went.

Rachelle J.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,2,1/24/2016,"Honestly cannot say enough wonderful things about this clinic and all of the people there. I've been battling an infection off and on for over a month and it was time to go back to the doc. Dr. Rastegar saw me right away - I never even sat down in the lobby. He was thorough and kind, and never once made me feel rushed. Gave me a shot and prescribed some antibiotics and steroids and sent me on my way. This was truly the best experience I've ever had with any doctor and their office. The Yelp reviews you see here (which prompted me to pay them a visit) do not lie!",,,,,,,,,,

DJ S.,"Altadena, CA",0,40,6/7/2016,"I received good service and there wasn't a wait at 8am. However, when they quoted me the price before seeing the doctor, I asked why it's so expensive and they weren't very honest. They said that my insurance has a $250 deductible that I haven't met so my appointment would be $150 plus any tests etc. I was confused and told them I thought I just had a copay for urgent care. The woman said she would check my insurance again, then returned and confirmed that I need to meet my $250 deductible, then was covered at 80%. Once again, I told her that I thought I had a copay. She clarified that this was not the case. I was not feeling well and having trouble breathing (hence being at urgent care) so I just said fine and went ahead with the appointment. It wasn't until I went home and was feeling a bit better that I did some research and learned that this urgent care isn't in the Blue Cross PPO network. If they had told me this when I was asking about my coverage, I would have left and gone to a covered urgent care and only paid $10 instead of the $200 I paid here. My fault for not looking into this before the appointment, but I asked them twice why the fee was so high and they were misleading with their answer.",18,8,3,,,,,,,

Patricia B.,"Los Angeles, CA",13,14,12/26/2017,"This was my 3rd time in two years going to Downton Urgent Care on San Pedro. Â They moved to a new space in the same building and it's bigger and more open. Â But what hasn't changed is the awesome service of their staff. Â I had to go the Saturday before Christmas and everyone was so helpful and kind. Â Amando was a great male nurse who made me feel confident and relaxed. Â Dr. Peter Chung is the best. This is the second time I was lucky enough to have him working on the day I had to go. Â If he had a personal private practice he would be my choice for my Primary care physician. Â He is never rushed, he is so attentive and listens to what you say. He explains things in language that you understand and compassionate and intelligent.

Gena T.,"Golden, CO",15,12,12/28/2015,"I just moved here from out of state, so when it came to looking for a doctor to help when I got sick, it was very difficult. My insurance company had mentioned a few places, but appeared they weren't really urgent care when I had called, or were booked out several weeks and I had also been told it would be tough to find a doctor since I am new to the area/not an established patient. After that route failed, I decided to just google online ""urgent care,"" found this place, and was happy with the Yelp app details. I then called with some questions and they answered promptly and were very helpful while I struggled to talk due to my cold (lost voice). Not only were they open later than I expected, it was easy/free to park, staff was friendly, efficient, and I was in and out with prescription in hand in 15-20 minutes (approximately). Much appreciated since I spent more time at the pharmacy afterwards than I did at the doctor. When I'm sick next time, I'm sure I'll go back here, but hopefully (with his recommendations) I won't need to be back that soon!",6,1,2,,,,,,,
Christine V N.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,6,1/24/2016,"Best experience at an urgent care. I arrived Sunday at noon, and the doctor was able to see me within 15 minutes. The area was clean and safe. The waiting room and exam room were clean as well. The doctor was great. The urgent care carried the medication I needed, so I didn't have to stop by the pharmacy.

Rosie G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,16,6/28/2017,"I love this doctor! On Saturday, I went to my usual clinic and they did not think I was sick enough to be seen by a doctor because they were too full so they recommended I went to the ER. I wasn't going to waste my entire day off at the ER. I let a few days pass and this morning I couldn't speak nor swallow without cringing in pain. I went to my usual clinic again and they denied me once again! They wanted me to wait to see if someone cancelled. I went to an old clinic and they denied my insurance. I gave up and headed to some urgent care in Chinatown and they were closed :( I was having such a bad morning and I was already fed up and wanted to just go home and sleep. Then I googled urgent care near me and this location popped up. I got there and in a minute I was already getting checked for vitals. I'm so glad I found this place!

Marc S.,"Anaheim, CA",0,3,4/13/2017,"I've been to urgent care facilities before but nothing like this one. Firstly, there is free parking inside the same building right next to the facility. The place looks contemporary and is very clean. The receptionists and nurses are all dressed in black uniforms ready to impress. I was greeted with big smiles and was asked several times if I wanted water. The wait was about 15 minutes before I was called in and probably another 15 minutes before I was able to see the doctor. In the mean time, I had to fill up a couple of forms and was later attended by the nurse who took my temperature, blood pressure, my weight and asked me the purpose of my visit. Dr. Chung looked and acted in a very professional manner. He was very attentive, asked the right questions and gave me a chance to answer. I did not feel rushed. I was also able to pick up my prescription on the way out and saved myself a trip to the pharmacy. I also got a follow-up call this morning to see how I was doing. Overall, it was a great experience.",,,,,,,,,,
Wendy F.,"Troutdale, OR",2,8,1/13/2016,"I've been to many different urgent cares and in different regions of the country, and my experience here was the best by far. The staff was friendly and efficient upon my arrival, and, amazingly, there was no waiting. Dr. Avarian was thorough in taking my history and performing the exam, and he displayed comprehensive knowledge about both my preexisting conditions (some uncommon) and the illness that brought me to urgent care. He was compassionate and patient, and he listened to what I had to say. Dr. Avarian prescribed appropriate therapies, including those that would help me feel better as well as those that would kill the germs making me sick. The discharge process was fast, and parking was free. A day or two later, someone from the Practice called me to make sure I was feeling better. As a disabled person all too familiar with health care facilities and personnel, I recommend this Urgent Care without hesitation.",,1,,,,,,,,

The check in receptionist was awesome and took our information quickly and got us back to the doctors area fast as could be (who wants flu people around,right).We met two nurses who took the vitals etc, then a fantastic doctor who did some preliminary listening for pneumonia etc and then came the dreaded nose swab - damn that's nasty - to determine if in fact you have the FLU! and of course we did, charming just charming. Next for me is a quick breathing treatment because Houston air is a bit sucky for people with asthma and then here comes the shot glass of steroids and Tamiflu.

The Ultrasound technician came in stating she had been at work all day and she was ready to go home, she was coughing, and seemed very uninterested being there. The doctor informed me that my HCG level had dropped to 203 so they believed I was threatening miscarriage. They discharged me and told me to follow up with my OB/GYN again. On 01/07/2019 I had my first visit with my OB/GYN at Complete Women's Health Center. They were more compassionate, helpful, and worked hard to figure out the REAL issue(Dr. McIntosh). I was in so much pain that my doctor ordered me to be transferred to the ER at the Women's Hospital of Texas in a wheelchair. They did ONE ultrasound and figured out a misdiagnosis that SignatureCare provided. I was experiencing an Ectopic Pregnancy grown to 5cm in my right Fallopian tube. I had emergency laparoscopic surgery done 30 minutes after my ultrasound. I currently only have one Fallopian tube and my chances for another pregnancy is lowered. SignatureCare is the worst so please do not waste your time or money going there. They only care about getting paid by your insurance they really don't care about finding the real issue of your visit. One of the doctors called me last week questioning me about a survey that I completed before leaving on December 30, 2018. They deserved the negative survey plus more in my eyes. PLEASE STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS PLACE. I don't want you to experience the same pain I have.",Read more,,,,,

They quickly tried to find out what was wrong with me and tried their best to make sure I was comfortable. Well, they could not figure out what was wrong with me and ended up transferring me to a different ER which was a DEATH TRAP.I really wish they could have diagnosed me correctly and treated me at SignatureCare instead of transferring me to another ER.",35,,,,,,,,,

They were not in network with my insurance... Now yes I did sign the palate to accept financial responsibility of my visit but I was under the impression that I was just paying what my insurance would not cover....

Travis J.,"Houston, TX",9,2,12/11/2016,"GOT AN EXTRA $1300 DOLLARS LYING AROUND? OF COURSE YOU DO!!!BUT DOES BURNING IT IN THE GARBAGE SOUND LIKE IT'S WORTH THE HASSLE?! OF COURSE NOT!!!Who has the time to stress about THE FASTEST way to be swindled out of cash when THIS place is open? Like many of you, I'm without costly health insurance, and not because of the price-tag, but because it's SO MUCH FUN!I've had chronic cough & flu symptoms for few weeks, and even after finishing a round of antibiotics, the symptoms still haven't gone away. In fact, they're bad enough that I tried to have them treated at 4am on a Saturday, because WHAT ELSE WOULD I BE DOING?Inside the attractive facilities, an EXTREMELY friendly staff was prompt and courteous (especially the sleeping security guard...he had an intensely calming effect), but when I didn't have $1300 for x-rays I was suddenly informed that this was ""no longer an emergency,"" and there was NOTHING they could do. Given the astonishing medical breakthroughs in recent years (for instance cataract-melting steroids, a re-engineered polio virus that treats cancer, and the world's FIRST SUCCESSFUL PENIS TRANSPLANT), you can imagine my surprise! But as I said (and in case you forgot), the helpful, attentive staff and I were LITERALLY OUT OF OPTIONS.Since I was prepared to spend up to $500 or say even $750 dollars on tests or treatment (on the off-chance I'd receive say, oh I don't know, some free baby-aspirin, a brochure on Christian Science, or maybe even some lukewarm tap water), I asked if there were any possible alternatives. The smiling associate went to check and while waiting I overhead some nurses openly discussing how much more money they made on the weekends. This got me thinking: GEE, I REALLY SHOULD HAVE MORE MONEY THAN I DO. SHOULDA BEEN A NURSE I GUESS!!!Sadly, all I could do was leave kicking myself, processing the harsh reality that not having thirteen individual one hundred dollar bills for ghost pictures of my insides wasn't just my fault, it was MY MISTAKE.So what's the ""take-away"" here? Well for starters, DON'T BE POOR. Basically that. Requiring ""urgent care"" or ""medical attention"" isn't for you to decide, especially because it doesn't have anything to do with your actual health. And secondly, if you ARE poor (over even upper middle-class!) then there's probably nothing physically wrong with you. And finally, spend less time (basically none) when you're sick trying to do anything about it. You'd be wise to focus what little energy and strength you DO actually have on finding, getting, and having more money. Because at SignatureCare Emergency Center, being alive isn't just not affordable, it's inconvenient, and we can't expect them to lie to us for free. HAPPY HOLIDAYS!",,2,Business Owner,"We are sorry to hear that you were unhappy with our billing processes. We'd like to get more information about your experience.

Jayne N.,"Houston, TX",0,5,5/27/2017,"Went to this emergency center today due to numbness in legs and pain in my right side ovary. The process from check-in until release was so flawless. I have never been to a medical facility where so many of the medical staff were so friendly and attentive. They were all wonderful, Particularly Dr. Adam Boester, whose calm demeanor tremendously eased my panic mode. Dr. Boester thoroughly and patiently addressed each one of my concerns. (And there were many!) My exams were completed with care and diligence. Although it wasn't something serious, I thought it was and I'm glad I had somewhere to go to get all of the right tests to ease my mind. Thank you to all the kind staff and to Dr. Boester who went above and beyond to make sure I was comfortable, but most of all took the time to listen to me, which is what every doctor should aim to do more of, with regard to their patients. I'm so glad I decided to go to this emergency room. I had the most compassionate and thorough diagnosis and treatment than I have ever had at any doctors office.",,,,,,,,,,
Erika P.,"Houston, TX",0,6,3/19/2017,"Our 5 year old hurt her neck so we came to SignatureCare emergency center Montrose. They got us in a room and made our daughter, Kennedy feel safe and assured her not to be scared and that everything was going to be ok. They helped calm her down, which made the whole process of exams and xrays/ct's that much easier. As parents, they were very precise, detailed, professional, and very kind. They covered all the details very well and answered our questions thoroughly. I was very impressed by each staff member and left knowing if our family ever needed ER care, we would return here.",,,,,,,,,,
Andrea F.,"Honolulu, HI",0,2,5/30/2017,"I was visiting Houston from Austin for a short overnight stay. I woke up in the middle of the night with a headache and while rubbing my head- found a tick from what I assume was a recent camping trip. After freaking out, I called this clinic. They were helpful on the phone and I decided to head straight there. I was greeted by Sindy, who was very helpful and then taken back right away by RN- Christine. She performed an assessment and vitals right away and was very pleasant and knowledgeable. Dr. Zhen was just as pleasant and knowledgeable as well, and performed a thorough assessment. They treated me and gave me info on tick bites and helped ease my anxiety. Check out again with Sindy was very pleasant and she was very helpful and accommodating. I could not have asked for a better experience, and I am so glad that I chose this emergency clinic to go to and would highly recommend it to everyone!!",,,,,,,,,,
Ikita C.,"Houston, TX",0,3,8/16/2015,"I usually don't write reviews but this ER is like no other. I've never walked into an ER and have people move as fast as the staff here. From the receptionist at the front desk, to the nurses and even the Doctors, they were not only prompt but showed they cared as much about my problem as I did. Dr. Bansal didn't try to just give me meds. to mask the pain, He done a complete work up. I mean all of this from an ER! There are hospitals that will tell you to address one main problem and move on. Not here! He sat and explained what and why he was doing what he was doing and answered my questions patiently. At no time did I feel like the staff was trying to rush out the room. The nurses rounded in a timely manner all why asking if I needed anything, their tones were of true care that if I asked they wouldn't hesitate. Â Not to mention the cleanliness of the rooms. Â Did I forget to mention there's a mini refrigerator in the room stocked with at least 8 different types of beverages. I must say this is patient care at its finest. This place most definitely hold true to its name and motto, Â SignatureCare. No matter you location if you want not just prompt service, but adequate care this is the place to come and I live in Pearland. We need more ER 'so like this with such professional standards.",1,,,,,,,,,
Theatre B.,"Plano, TX",0,2,7/12/2016,"We just moved to Houston and have been told that everyone is just a number, especially in the medical department. Â SignatureCare could not be farther from the truth! Â They were the most pleasant people we have worked with, and they treated my husband like a person, not a number. When we arrived, I was very upset, my husband had a head wound and it took the police over 20 minutes to drive so we could leave to get him medical help. Â However at Signature Care they understood my worry and quickly put myself and my husband to ease. Â They took us back quickly and he was scene by the dr. quickly. Â The whole facility was clean, it was organized, and the people we met were all smiles, they truly cared, and it showed. Â  Afterwords I asked where the nearest CVS was to get my husband some gatorade, and they opened their fridge and told me to take a few with me, so didn't have to make an extra trip, ad I could get him home quicker. Â I was BLOWN AWAY With their CUSTOMER SERVICE, and THIS IS THE BEST EMERGENCY ROOM IN HOUSTON!!!!!!!We will make this my only medical facility, and if we ever have a problem this is where we will go.",,,,,,,,,,

Marta A.,""San Jose, CA",15,44,57,4/5/2022,"Probably the best experience possible at a medical help provider!I had a minor infection in my finger that i was going to put off as most of these places are so bad!!! But thought better of it and went anyway. What a wonderful surprise: Polite welcome, a paperless checkin system so you don't have to fill out any papers. (hard to wright with a messed up finger anyway). I was a walk-in yet was seen in less than 15 mins as promised over the phone. The nurse, polite, the doctor friendly and very informative. All in all a five star experience. Meds and radiology onsite too. Awesome!!!!Thanks."

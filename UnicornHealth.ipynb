    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to solve a business problem. We will design the data architecture for a small private clinic. In order to do this, we need to understand the problem. After this, we will design a business process diagram to visualize the business model. Then, we will look at all relevant data and finally, we will understand how all the data relates. We will transition the business to a cloud environment to automize the data process."
